*DESCRIPTION:A real-time chat application using WebSockets and React.js enables instant messaging between users by maintaining a persistent connection between the client and the server. The backend, built with Node.js and the ws library, handles WebSocket connections, broadcasting messages to all connected clients. The frontend, developed with React.js, listens for incoming messages and updates the chat window dynamically without refreshing the page. This ensures a seamless, low-latency communication experience, making it ideal for real-time interactions like customer support, group chats, and collaborative tools.
